ros-humble-rclrs-tests (0.3.0-1bullseye) bullseye; urgency=high

  * Format all code with group_imports = StdExternalCrate (#272 <https://github.com/marcoag/ros2_rust/issues/272>)
  * Bump package versions to 0.3 (#274 <https://github.com/marcoag/ros2_rust/issues/274>)
  * Extend SubscriptionCallback trait to ReadOnlyLoanedMessage (#266 <https://github.com/marcoag/ros2_rust/issues/266>)
    This was not a straightforward extension because
    1. ReadOnlyLoanedMessage has a lifetime
    2. The take_loaned_message() method was restricted to Subscription<T: RmwMessage>, i.e. not available
    for subscriptions on idiomatic messages.
    This has been fixed and now the method is implemented for Subscription<T: Message> like the other
    take* methods â€“ though you still will get an RMW-native loaned message even if T is the idiomatic
    message type, because idiomatic message types can never be loaned.
  * Generalize callbacks for subscriptions (#260 <https://github.com/marcoag/ros2_rust/issues/260>)
    * Generalize callbacks to subscriptions
    By implementing a trait (SubscriptionCallback) on valid function signatures,
    and making subscriptions accept callbacks that implement this trait, we can now
    * Receive both plain and boxed messages
    * Optionally receive a MessageInfo along with the message, as the second argument
    * Soon, receive a loaned message instead of an owned one
    This corresponds to the functionality in any_subscription_callback.hpp in rclcpp.
  * Test for Send and Sync implementations, and add missing implementations (#254 <https://github.com/marcoag/ros2_rust/issues/254>)
  * Add rclrs_test package for unit/integration tests (#239 <https://github.com/marcoag/ros2_rust/issues/239>)
    This package is meant to test behaviors with dependencies that don't
    belong in the rclrs crate - namely, msgs
