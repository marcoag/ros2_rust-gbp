ros-humble-examples-rclrs-minimal-pub-sub (0.3.0-1jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * Format all code with group_imports = StdExternalCrate (#272 <https://github.com/marcoag/ros2_rust/issues/272>)
  * Bump package versions to 0.3 (#274 <https://github.com/marcoag/ros2_rust/issues/274>)
  * Extend SubscriptionCallback trait to ReadOnlyLoanedMessage (#266 <https://github.com/marcoag/ros2_rust/issues/266>)
    This was not a straightforward extension because
    1. ReadOnlyLoanedMessage has a lifetime
    2. The take_loaned_message() method was restricted to Subscription<T: RmwMessage>, i.e. not available
    for subscriptions on idiomatic messages.
    This has been fixed and now the method is implemented for Subscription<T: Message> like the other
    take* methods â€“ though you still will get an RMW-native loaned message even if T is the idiomatic
    message type, because idiomatic message types can never be loaned.
  * Add support for loaned messages (#212 <https://github.com/marcoag/ros2_rust/issues/212>)
